## Summary

The dashboards project is a project at FHI concerned with running automated analyses on data.

In principle, the dashboards project is split up into three parts:

1. The overarching infrastructure (i.e. Docker containers, continuous integration, chron jobs, etc.)
2. The R package for each automated analysis
3. The executable for each automated analysis
