## Analysis Docker Image {#analysisdocker}

### Images

Our analysis Docker images are based off the [rocker](https://rocker-project.org) images. More specifically, the [rocker/verse:3.5.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/verse/) image.

This Docker image is then expanded upon by a separate Dockerfile [raw996/dhadley](https://github.com/raubreywhite/docker/blob/master/dhadley/Dockerfile). This Docker image is automatically rebuilt by `Jenkins` on `linux` whenever the repository is updated. The resultant Docker image is pushed to [raw996/dhadley:3.5.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dhadley/). This image is a general-purpose analysis image, with no sensitive information in it.

This Docker image is then expanded upon by a separate Dockerfile [raw996/dashboards_r](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/Dockerfile). This Docker image is automatically rebuilt by `Jenkins` on `linux` whenever the repository is updated. The resultant Docker image is locally tagged as `raw996/dashboards_r:test` and then a number of integration tests are performed on it. If the integration tests are passed, then the Docker image is retagged and pushed to [raw996/dashboards_r:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_r/). This image is private as it contains passwords and email addresses.

### File Structure

Inside `raw996/dashboards_r` we have the following file structure:

```
/data_raw/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
/data_clean/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
/data_app/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
/results/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/  <soft linked to /r>
  |-- <OTHER R PACKAGES INSTALLED HERE>/
  |-- fhi/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
  |-- <OTHER R PACKAGES INSTALLED HERE>/
```

Note that we have a soft link between `/r` and `/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/`.

### cron {#cron}

We use [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to schedule the analyses. The schedule is specified in [crontab](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/crontab).

The cronjobs are only activated when the environmental variable `ADD=cron` is defined. Cronjobs are then activated through [add_cron.sh](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/add_cron.sh).

In principle, cronjobs should only be activated on `smhb`.

### autofs {#autofs}

We use [autofs](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Autofs) to connect to the F network. The network locations, username, and password are specified in [auto.mounts](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/auto.mounts).

Autofs is only activated when the environmental variable `ADD_AUTOFS=yes` is defined. Autofs is then activated through [add_autofs.sh](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/add_autofs.sh).

In principle, autofs should only be activated on `smhb`.

## Reverse Proxy Docker Image

We use nginx as a reverse proxy to make rstudio server available to the developers.

The relevant Dockerfile is [here]([raw996/dashboards_r](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_nginx/Dockerfile) and is pushed to [raw996/dashboards_nginx:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_nginx/) after integration testing is passed.

## Docker Compose

[Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is used to integrate these Docker images into the local filesystem. We have multiple docker-compose files for different reasons:

- For [production](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/docker-compose-prod.yml) on `smhb`
- For [testing](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/docker-compose-test.yml) on `linux`
- For [development](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/docker-compose-dev.yml) on a dev computer
