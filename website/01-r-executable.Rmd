# R executable for each automated analysis

An automated analysis needs to:

1. Know the location of the data/results folders
2. Load in the data
3. Load in the analysis functions
4. Run the analyses
5. Save the results

The R executable (commonly called `RunProcess.R`) is responsible for these tasks. We can think of it as an extremely short and extremely high-level script that implements the analysis scripts.

All of these R executables live in the [dashboards](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/dashboards/) repository.

Inside the [dashboards](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/dashboards/) repository we have:
